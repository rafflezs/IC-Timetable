## :books: Timetabling
Mostly applied in logistic and engineering, timetabling is the act of construct tables with given resources,
in order to generate the best "time-efficient" task.

It's application ranges from industries, medical consultory to, in this context, educational institutes.

## :mortar_board: This application
This is a "general" purpose timetabling algorithm, with non-serialization implications, meaning it could be
applied both in colleges and middle schools (mostly brazilian educational context).

## :computer: Technologies
[C++] (https://www.cplusplus.com/) - backbone of this application, all heuristics are writen using it.
[Python] (https://www.python.org/) - ellegant solution to some C++ gaps.

Uses XLSX stantardized tables to input data into it.
